## SIMIANVIZ UI

### Building the UI

> You must have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) installed to build the UI.

To build the UI `cd` in to `ui` directory and run `npm install`. Next run `npm run dev`.
You should now have a local instance running on port `8000`.

A big thanks is due to [Kurtis Kemple](https://github.com/kkemple) for cleaning up the initial javascript/D3 UI code and building simianviz as a single page app.
